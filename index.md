# Sean Wong's Programming Tutorials

Welcome! This is a **personal collection of programming tutorials**, created to **retain knowledge for myself**.  
It covers **frontend, backend, Python, Django, DRF, React, TypeScript, and architecture patterns**.

---

## About This Collection

This repository is **a self-curated knowledge base**. All tutorials are written by me as I learn and experiment.  
The goal is **easy reference, full-stack architecture learning, and retention of practical programming knowledge**.

**Core Principles:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend, backend, and database layers are distinct.
- **Modularity & Reusability:** Components and services can be reused.
- **Event-Driven / Reactive:** Observer patterns used for updates.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):** Shared logic placed in services/utilities.
