# 📊 Slides Directory (Personal)

This directory is my **personal slide store** — a collection of **concise, presentation-ready slides** created **for my own use**.

These slides help me:

* Think clearly about complex topics
* Explain ideas quickly when needed
* Revisit concepts without re-learning from scratch

They are not meant to be polished decks for public distribution.

---

## 📁 Contents

Each file or subdirectory represents a **self-contained slide deck** for a specific topic.

Topics may include:

* Technical concepts (systems, architecture, data, programming)
* Product or platform thinking
* Process flows, decision frameworks, trade-offs
* Business, strategy, or operational ideas

The common goal is **clarity for future-me**.

## 🎯 How I Use These Slides

These slides are used for:

* Personal reference & revision
* Preparing for events, courses, discussions, or presentations
* Explaining ideas informally to others
* Structuring my thoughts before writing or speaking

They prioritize **speed and clarity** over completeness.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

* One core idea per slide
* Prefer mental models over details
* Slides support spoken explanations
* Fewer slides > more slides

If a concept fits in one slide, it stays in one slide.

---

## ✍️ Notes to Self

* Most decks are designed for **quick recall (2–10 minutes)**
* Slides may be rough, opinionated, or context-dependent
* Update freely — perfection is not the goal

> These slides exist to help me think, not to impress.
