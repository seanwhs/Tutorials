# 🟨 JavaScript Slides (Personal)

This directory contains my **personal JavaScript slide decks**.

These slides exist primarily to help **future-me**:

* Recall how JavaScript *actually* works
* Explain tricky concepts quickly and accurately
* Prepare for presentations, teaching, or discussions
* Convert implicit understanding into explicit mental models

They are **not tutorials** and **not polished courseware**.

## 📁 What Lives Here

Each file or subdirectory is a **self-contained slide deck** focused on a *specific JavaScript concept*.

Typical topics include:

* Execution model (Call Stack, Event Loop, Queues)
* Async behavior (Promises, timers, async/await)
* Language semantics (scope, closures, `this`)
* Runtime behavior (browser vs Node.js differences)
* Common pitfalls & interview traps

Slides are intentionally small and focused.

## 🎯 How I Use These Slides

I use these slides to:

* Refresh my understanding in minutes, not hours
* Sanity-check my mental model before explaining something
* Teach or clarify concepts informally
* Distill complex ideas into simple explanations

If I can explain a concept confidently after reviewing the slides, they’ve done their job.

## 🧠 Design Rules (For Myself)

* One core idea per slide
* Prefer *why* over *what*
* Use mental models, diagrams, and timelines
* Minimal code — only what proves the point
* Fewer slides > more slides

If a slide needs heavy narration, that’s acceptable — clarity beats completeness.

## ✍️ Notes to Self

* Slides may be rough, opinionated, or context-specific
* Update aggressively as understanding improves
* Avoid turning slides into documentation

> These slides are memory aids and thinking tools — nothing more.
