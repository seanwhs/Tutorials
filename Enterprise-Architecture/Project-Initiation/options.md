# Guide: Initiation & Options Assessment (Buy vs. Build)

In an ecosystem of 50+ apps, "Build" is the most expensive choice. This guide ensures we make the right investment.

## Step 1: The "Reuse" Filter
Before proposing a new service, search the **Service Catalog (Backstage.io)**. 
* Does an existing API provide this functionality? 
* Can an existing service be extended without violating the "Single Responsibility Principle"?

## Step 2: Options Assessment (The 3 Pillars)
1. **Reuse:** Leverage existing Enterprise Assets.
2. **Buy (SaaS/COTS):** Is this a "Commodity" function? (e.g., Auth, Email, CMS). If yes, Buy.
3. **Build:** Is this "Core Domain" logic that provides a competitive advantage? If yes, Build on the **Golden Path**.

## Step 3: Solution Overview
Create a high-level abstraction (The Outline) before the detailed Solution Design.
* **Actors:** Who interacts with the system?
* **Data Domain:** Who is the "Source of Truth"?
* **Strategic Fit:** Which Archetype does this serve?
