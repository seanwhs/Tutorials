# Guide: Visualizing the EA Delivery Lifecycle

To maintain order across 50+ apps, every project must flow through these four architectural checkpoints.

### 1. The Strategy Filter
Does the project align with our current business archetype? 
* **Defensive:** Simplify. 
* **Aggressive:** Scale.

### 2. The Conceptual Design
The **Solution Overview** (see template above) is drafted to ensure we aren't rebuilding the wheel.



### 3. The Logical Blueprint
Detailed mapping of the **Saga**, **Outbox**, and **Identity** patterns. This is where the technical "Golden Path" is applied.

### 4. The Operational Handover
The service is registered in the **Service Catalog**, SLOs are set, and the "Snowflake" it replaced (if any) is scheduled for decommissioning.
