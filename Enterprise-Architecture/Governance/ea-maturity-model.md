# Maturity Level

# The EA Maturity Model (Self-Assessment)

We measure our progress across five levels. Our goal is not for every one of the 50+ apps to be at Level 5, but for all **Critical Scalers** to be at Level 4+.

| Level | State | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1: Initial** | **Ad-hoc** | No standard blueprints; high technical debt; siloed data. |
| **2: Managed** | **Documented** | HLSOs are used; basic observability exists; team ownership is clear. |
| **3: Defined** | **Standardized** | **Golden Path** is active; IaC modules are used; mTLS is enforced. |
| **4: Predictable** | **Measured** | SLOs drive decisions; QARs are regular; DR failovers are proven. |
| **5: Optimizing** | **Adaptive** | AI-driven scaling; automated "Harvesting"; constant modernization. |

### The "Day 2" Evolution: API Economy & Ecosystems

As your 50+ apps stabilize, the next strategic move is to treat your internal APIs as a **Product**. This moves you from being a "Cost Center" to a "Value Multiplier."

* **Internal Marketplace:** Create a "Developer Portal" where teams can discover and "subscribe" to existing APIs, preventing the creation of the 51st app that does exactly what the 12th app already does.
* **Contract First:** Before writing code, teams must publish their **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** spec. This allows consumers to build in parallel using "Mock Servers."

### Summary of the EA Framework

You have successfully constructed a world-class architecture repository. Here is your final checklist for success:

* [x] **Strategy:** Are we Defensive, Proactive, or Aggressive?
* [x] **Patterns:** Are we using Sagas for consistency and Strangler Figs for legacy?
* [x] **Governance:** Are we measuring the Golden Signals and enforcing Zero Trust?
* [x] **Lifecycle:** Are we reviewing quarterly and harvesting the "Zombies"?
* [x] **Automation:** Is the "Architect-in-a-Box" guarding our PRs?

### Final Reflection

The transition from 50 disconnected apps to a **Governed Ecosystem** is the difference between a "Software Shop" and a "Digital Powerhouse." You now have the blueprints, the processes, and the authority to lead that change.
