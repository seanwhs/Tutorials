# Enterprise IT Governance & Strategy

Governance is not a bottleneck; it is a **velocity multiplier**. By standardizing non-differentiating decisions, we allow teams to focus on core business value.

## Strategic Assets
* **Principles.md**: The "Ten Commandments" of our architecture (e.g., "API First," "Decoupled Data").
* **Tech Radar**: A visualization of technologies we Adopt, Trial, Assess, or Hold.
* **Service Lifecycle**: Definitions for how a service moves from a "Lab Experiment" to "Mission Critical" to "Decommissioned."
* **Snowflake Audit**: The framework for identifying and sunsetting legacy tech debt that exists outside the Golden Path.

## The Architecture Review Board (ARB)
The ARB uses these documents to ensure that all 50+ applications are rowing in the same technical direction.
