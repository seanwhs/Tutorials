# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory serves as the immutable "logbook" of our technical evolution. While code represents the current state, ADRs capture the **context, rationale, and trade-offs** behind our decisions.

## Why ADRs?
* **Prevent Decision Amnesia**: Understand why a choice was made 2 years ago.
* **Contextual Onboarding**: Help new senior hires understand the existing constraints.
* **Alignment**: Ensure major shifts are debated and documented, not just "implemented."

## Status Definitions
* **Proposed**: Under review by stakeholders.
* **Accepted**: The current organizational standard.
* **Deprecated**: Superseded by a newer decision.

## Format
We follow the Nygard (MADR) format. Every ADR must include **Context**, **Decision**, and **Consequences** (both positive and negative).
