# Compliance, Security, & Risk Management

This directory bridges the gap between Engineering and our Legal/Security requirements. It codifies the guardrails required to protect the organization and our customers.

## Standards
* **Data Sovereignty**: Policies on PII handling, encryption at rest, and regional data residency.
* **Threat Modeling**: Mandatory templates for identifying attack vectors during the design phase.
* **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Tier-based requirements for RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
* **Audit Readiness**: Pre-configured checklists for SOC2, ISO27001, and GDPR compliance.

## Operational Guardrails
No service is "Enterprise Ready" until it satisfies the compliance checks defined herein.
