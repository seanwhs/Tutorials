# Core Enterprise Architecture Domains

Enterprise Architecture is typically split into several domains that describe different aspects of an enterprise:

## 1. Business Architecture
- Defines business processes, goals, and capabilities.
- Describes how business units function and interact.

## 2. Information / Data Architecture
- Models key data entities and flows.
- Ensures data is consistent, accessible, and governed.

## 3. Application Architecture
- Maps applications and services to business functions.
- Shows how systems interact with each other.

## 4. Technology / Infrastructure Architecture
- Describes servers, networks, platforms and environments.
- Ensures technology choices support performance, availability and scalability.

## 5. Security Architecture
- Integrates security concerns across all domains.
- Covers controls, policies, and identity management.

*Note:* These domains are standard components in EA frameworks such as TOGAF and Zachman.
