# EA Artifacts and Deliverables

Enterprise Architecture produces various outputs (“artifacts”) that communicate information across stakeholders.

## Considerations / Principles
High-level business and IT rules that guide decisions.

## Standards / Reference Models
Technology and process standards that all projects should conform to.

## Business Capability Model
A map of high-level business functions, often used for prioritization.

## Roadmaps
Future-state vision showing initiative timelines and dependencies.

## Landscape Diagrams
Visual representation of current systems, data, and interactions.

## Solution Overviews and Design Documents
Documents that translate business needs into technical solutions.

### Why These Matter
Artifacts provide traceable decision records, enable governance, and guide project planning.
