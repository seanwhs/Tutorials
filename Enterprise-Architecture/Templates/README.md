# The Golden Path: Scaffolding & Starters

This directory contains the **executable** portion of our architecture. These templates allow developers to bootstrap production-ready services in minutes rather than weeks.

## Available Scaffolds
* **Microservice Starters**: Pre-configured templates for Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot), and Go.
* **IaC Modules**: Standardized Terraform/Pulumi modules for AWS/Azure/GCP resources that are pre-hardened for security.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Reusable GitHub Action workflows for automated testing, linting, and canary deployments.

## The Goal
A developer should be able to run a single command to generate a service that is **born** with logging, tracing, security headers, and deployment pipelines already configured.
