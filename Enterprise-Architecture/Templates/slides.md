### Presentation Outline: Securing the Future of Enterprise Architecture

This outline is designed for a leadership presentation (C-Suite/VPs). It translates the technical rigor of your **50+ app ecosystem** into business value: **Risk Mitigation, Cost Control, and Speed to Market.**

---

#### **Slide 1: The Challenge of Scale**

* **The Problem:** Managing 50+ applications without a framework leads to "Architectural Rot," where maintenance costs eat 80% of the budget.
* **The Symptom:** Slow releases, frequent outages, and data silos.
* **The Vision:** Transitioning from "Accidental Architecture" to a "Governed Ecosystem."

#### **Slide 2: Strategic Alignment (Scenarios & Archetypes)**

* **Value:** We stop over-engineering simple tools and under-engineering critical ones.
* **Concept:** By categorizing projects as **Defensive, Proactive, or Aggressive**, we ensure that capital is allocated where it provides the highest return.
* **Impact:** 20% reduction in wasted engineering hours by right-sizing the architecture (Utility vs. Scaler).

#### **Slide 3: Faster Delivery via the "Golden Path"**

* **Value:** Reducing "Time to Value" for new business needs.
* **Concept:** Our **Blueprints** and **IaC Modules** provide a pre-approved fast lane for developers.
* **Impact:** New services move from "Idea" to "Production" weeks faster because the security, networking, and observability are "built-in," not bolted on.

#### **Slide 4: Protecting the Core (Risk & Reliability)**

* **Value:** Reducing the cost of downtime and data breaches.
* **Concept:** Standardized **Observability** (The Four Golden Signals) and **Zero-Trust Networking** mean we catch failures before they become headlines.
* **Impact:** Predictable systems with measurable Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

#### **Slide 5: Asset Harvesting (Financial Discipline)**

* **Value:** Perpetual cost optimization.
* **Concept:** We don't just build; we **Harvest**. Our policy ensures that low-value "Zombie Apps" are decommissioned to fund the next "Aggressive" innovation.
* **Impact:** Self-funding innovation through the elimination of technical debt and redundant cloud spend.

#### **Slide 6: The Roadmap & Investment**

* **The Ask:** Continued support for the EA Governance function and the "Platform Team" that builds these Golden Paths.
* **The Return:** A leaner, faster, and more resilient enterprise capable of out-maneuvering competitors.
