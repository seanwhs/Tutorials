# AI-Centric Systems (Agentic Architecture)

Systems are moving from **applications with AI** to **AI-orchestrated systems**.

## Core Patterns

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Ground LLMs in private, real-time data using vector databases
- Ensures contextual and secure AI responses

### Agentic Orchestration
- LLMs dynamically select services or microservices based on user intent
- Replaces static workflows


```
User -> Agent -> Tool / Service / DB
```
