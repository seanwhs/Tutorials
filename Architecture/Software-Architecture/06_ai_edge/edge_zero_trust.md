# Edge-Native & Zero-Trust Architecture

## Edge Computing

- Moves computation closer to users/devices
- Enables sub-10ms latency for real-time AI and IoT workloads

## Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA)

- Assumes no trusted network boundary
- Every request is authenticated and encrypted
- Typically enforced via a **service mesh**
