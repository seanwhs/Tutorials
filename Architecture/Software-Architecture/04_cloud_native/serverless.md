# Serverless (Function-as-a-Service)

Serverless abstracts infrastructure, letting developers focus on **functions** rather than servers.

## Characteristics

- Event-driven, ephemeral execution
- Ideal for bursty workloads and asynchronous processing
- Pay-per-use model

## Trade-offs

- Cold start latency
- Observability challenges
- Vendor lock-in
