# Data Mesh Example (Conceptual)

Teams own data as products:


```
[ Sales Data ] [ Inventory Data ] [ Finance Data ]
      |               |                 |
+----------- Federated Governance ---------------+
```

- Each team is responsible for quality, versioning, and discoverability
- Central platform provides pipelines, storage, monitoring, and governance
