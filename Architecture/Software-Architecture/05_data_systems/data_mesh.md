# Data Mesh (Zhamak Dehghani)

Data Mesh applies **microservice principles to analytical data systems**.

## The Four Pillars

1. **Domain-Oriented Ownership** – teams own the data they produce
2. **Data as a Product** – discoverable, versioned, trustworthy
3. **Self-Serve Data Platform** – infrastructure is centralized, content is decentralized
4. **Federated Governance** – automated, global policy enforcement


```
[ Sales Data ] [ Shipping Data ] [ Finance Data ]
|                     |               |
+------------ Federated Governance -------------+
```
> Transforms pipelines into **products with accountable owners**.
